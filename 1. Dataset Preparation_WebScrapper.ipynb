An overwhelming majority (98%) of Israeli Jews agree all Jews should have the right to  move to Israel and receive immediate citizenship. Close to half (48 percent)  support the expulsion or transfer of Arabs from Israel, yet most secular Jews  disagree (58%) with this, as do 54 percent of those in the center politically (more so from the left). Meanwhile, Israeli Arabs,  currently about one-in-five of the country's adults, generally do not think Israel can be a Jewish state and a democracy at the same time. Fewer  Arabs (down 24 points) think a peaceful, two-state solution is possible, from 74% in 2013 to 50% now. Both groups are skeptical of the peace process: Israeli Arabs question the sincerity of the Israeli government in seeking a peace agreement, while Israeli Jews are equally skeptical about the sincerity of Palestinian leaders.

There were two dead and one injured, MacTavish's fellow Task Force 141 member, known only as Commander Yuri, who used to work for Makarov, in the explosion. This set off a chain of events leading to a helicopter crash, involving Makarov, Yuri, and Captain John Price. While all three survived the impact, Yuri was shot soon after by Makarov, and Price engaged in hand to hand combat with Makarov, where he eventually was able to overwhelm him. Makarov was killed by a cervical fracture, when his neck was wrapped in a loose hanging cord, and the glass floor underneath him collapsed.
