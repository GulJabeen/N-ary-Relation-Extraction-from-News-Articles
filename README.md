# N-ary-Relation-Extraction-from-News-Articles
This thesis presents three main contributions to the essential questions of the corresponding research. 
The ﬁrst contribution is data scraping from Wikipedia news articles using web-scraper, which further deals
with extraction of entities and relations from news events by using constituency parser from natural language processing toolkit.
The second contribution presents the annotation interface for annotation purposes. 
Finally, the third contribution pertains to annotated arguments and entities from the annotation interface, 
passed through the relation extraction framework based on Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Multi-Task Learning (MTL).
The model has been evaluated on datasets and its performance is measured on the evaluation metrics,
demonstrating the model’s eﬀectiveness with supervised learning and MTL, which has signiﬁcantly improved the extraction accuracy. 
Keywords: Information extraction, relation extraction, entity extraction, n-ary relation extraction,
constituency parser, annotation interface, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Multi-Task Learning (MTL).
